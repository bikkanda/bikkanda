### Hello ðŸ‘‹!

After a very enjoyable career as an associate professor of chemistry, I am now making the switch into data science and analytics.  I am eager to learn new skills and tools that are rapidly becoming a necessity in our data-driven world.  Although I am fairly new to computer programming, I am excited to embark onto this new environment and possibly combine these new skills with my academic training as a chemist and a professor.
